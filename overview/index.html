        <p>The National Extension Technology Conference is an annual event that provides an opportunity for sharing and learning about innovative types and uses of information technology.  Participation is not limited to faculty and staff of Extension.  In fact, anyone with an interest in information technology and its uses in higher education, as well as in organization management, is welcome to participate.
