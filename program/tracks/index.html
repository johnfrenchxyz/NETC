        <!-- Client Support Track -->
        <p class="track-title-green">Client Support: Supporting the Extension Workforce:</p>
        The Extension professional is notoriously overextended and on the move. The technologies that they rely upon have to be usable, flexible, durable, reliable, maintainable and secure. Meeting the needs of this workforce requires solutions that are often innovative yet proven and dependable. Most of all, though, these solutions must be supportable.

        Over the course of our professional lives, we are influenced and molded by our formal education, our training, our personal experiences and our work environment. How can the IT professional establish realistic career goals, demonstrate adaptability and responsibility, and proactively and positively influence his or her own development?

        <p class="track-title-green">Systems &amp; Infrastructure: Enabling Service Delivery</p>
        The availability, durability, and extensibility of the technologies that underpin and facilitate our client-facing services are critical to our parent organizations' ability to deliver programs and maintain operations. The mission-critical nature of enabling services such as network connectivity, database management systems, web content management systems inherently place elevated demands upon the IT support structure.  How do we practically manage these "enabling" services to reduce the risk of failure or interruption?  What are cost effective alternatives to building and supporting an in-house infrastructure?  What are the relevant technological and resource trends?

        <p class="track-title-blue">Web &amp; Social Media: Delivering the Extension Message</p>
        The public at large continues to demonstrate a growing preference for interacting with businesses and service agencies online. To remain relevant, we must meet, if not exceed, client expectations of digital service delivery. How can we best facilitate Extension professionals as they serve their clientele online? How do we advise and support our parent organizations as the locus of engagement shifts away from physical spaces and toward the web and social media?
